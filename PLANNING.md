# Goal
Create a web based resource where people can determine how their personal finances
line up with the Money Guys' 'Financial Order of Operations' recommendations.

The first flow is a quiz format that will look at current savings values and savings
rates to determine where the user lies in the 9 Steps.

The user should input their:
- current cash savings (emergency fund)
- current high-interest (>=4%) debt balances
- current low-interest debt balances
- employer retirement match + contribution
- individual retirement contribution
- other investment contribution
- savings towards future expenses (children tuition, home purchase)

to receive a summary showing progress towards each of the 9 Steps.
I'm thinking a fuel gauge circular indicator, going from red to yellow to green.


## Limitations
I do not want to store any user data on my server 

Let's just do a frontend SPA, probably with React since I should
get comfier with more recent developments in that ecosystem.
